# Airport Interactive Web Map
This web map displays all the different airports in the United States. It is a choropleth map of the number of airports in each of the different states. So the states with more airports will be darker in color and the states with less airports will be lighter in color. The color of the airplane icon tells you whether or not there is a control tower for that specific airport.

The data sets for the airports comes from USGS, the data for the states comes from Mike Bostock of D3 and the basemap comes from CartoDB. Leaflet and Font Awesome contributed to the design aspects of the map (such as the airplane icons).
